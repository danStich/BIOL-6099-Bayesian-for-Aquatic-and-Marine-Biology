# First class 02/03/2026

## Necessary software

### R and RStudio
### XCode
### Rtools
### JAGS
### Stan

## Overarching student needs/interests following first meeting

### Presence absence       
### Counts
### Observation process
### Spatial 
### Temporal
### Coding tools (want to code models by hand)

## Pedagogical approach

### Use hands-on examples 
#### Send examples before meetings
#### Explain and/or modify models during meetings
##### Do we have time to freestyle code?
### Hierarchy & covariates layered throughout
### Model and algorithm diagnostics intro early/mid, then weekly
### Input/output wrangling, summarization, and plotting throughout
### Predictions and projections throughout

### Impose decision making on process
#### Distributional assumptions
#### Data transformations or representation
#### Software choice
#### Hierarchical structure

## Content
### Module 0: Bayesian terminology and tools (toy examples)
### Module 1: binomial models and likelihoods (pres/abs)
### Module 2: count models and likelihoods (sturgeon?)
### Module 3: state-space models (occupancy)
### Module 4: state-space models (abundance)
### Module 5: Bayesian p-values and PPCs/GOFs
### Module 6: spatial and temporal autocorrelation
### Module 7: constrained spatial networks
### Module 8: putting together the pieces (maybe SSNs by this point if I figure them out?)


### Other potential content ideas: 
#### Basic models like regression/anova/ancova?
#### Multi-state and markovian processes
#### Survival models or mark-recapture (this is it's own world, really, so basics)
#### Non-linear responses & cholesky decomposition in Stan
#### Multivariate responses/priors
#### Spatial stream network (SSN) analysis (can I get this Bayes'd in time?)
#### Time-series data? Can bake a lot of this into other examples
#### n-occupancy models for species at low abundance
#### Integrated population models (samge as mark-recap: basics)
