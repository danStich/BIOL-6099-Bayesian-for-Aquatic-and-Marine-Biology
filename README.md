# BIOL-6099-Bayesian-for-Aquatic-and-Marine-Biology
## Overview
This repository holds data, code, and models used for BIOL-6099 (Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling for Aquatic and Marine Biology). Data may be from published or ongoing studies, so please contact us directly if you are interested in using them.

## Directory structure
The main directory contains R scripts from class examples using JAGS or Stan. These are named using the data set and the sampler used for analysis in each script, which are separated for modularization. The main directory contains several sub-directories used to organize data or models in addition to some organizational files such as a `.gitignore` and this `README.md` file.

## Subdirectories

`data` contains all data files used for example scripts.
`models` contains all JAGS and Stan model files used in the example scripts.
